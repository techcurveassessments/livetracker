- **Detailed Analytics**: View pass/fail rates, scores, and completion statistics
- **Date-based Grouping**: Submissions organized by submission date
- **Individual Student Details**: Drill down into specific question-level results
- **Export Functionality**: Download submission data as CSV files
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded status for quick assessment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- AWS Account with S3 access
- AWS credentials configured

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd live-submission-tracker
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit boto3 pandas
```

3. Set up AWS credentials as environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1  # Optional, defaults to us-east-1
```

## Configuration

### S3 Bucket Structure

The application expects submissions to be stored in S3 with the following structure:

```
ltisubmissions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StudentName_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ q1/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_report.log
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ q2/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_report.log
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ q3/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_report.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AnotherStudent_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Test Report Format

Each `test_report.log` file should contain test results with:
- `[PASS]` markers for successful tests
- `[FAIL]` markers for failed tests

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. The dashboard will automatically load and display:
   - Overall statistics for each submission date
   - Individual student results
   - Question-level pass/fail details

## Dashboard Components

### Summary Metrics
- **Total Students**: Number of students who submitted
- **Average Score**: Mean score across all submissions
- **Perfect**: Count of students with all tests passing
- **Failed**: Count of students with failing submissions

### Student Details
Each student entry shows:
- **Name**: Extracted from folder name
- **Submission Time**: When the assignment was submitted
- **Score**: Total number of passed tests
- **Status**: Overall completion status with visual indicators
  - ‚úÖ Perfect: All tests passed
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Some tests passed
  - ‚ùå Failed: No tests passed or submission issues

### Question Breakdown
For each student, individual questions display:
- Question ID (q1, q2, etc.)
- Pass/fail counts
- Status indicator

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key | Required |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key | Required |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | AWS region | `us-east-1` |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Credentials Error**
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify IAM permissions for S3 access

2. **No Data Displayed**
   - Check S3 bucket name (`BUCKET_NAME` variable)
   - Verify folder structure matches expected format
   - Ensure test_report.log files exist

3. **Parsing Errors**
   - Student folder names should follow: `Name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format
   - Question folders should be named `q1`, `q2`, etc.

### Required IAM Permissions

Your AWS credentials need the following S3 permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ltisubmissions",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ltisubmissions/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Customization

### Changing Refresh Interval
Modify the `refresh_interval` variable (line 69) to adjust auto-refresh timing:
```python
refresh_interval = 30  # Refresh every 30 seconds
```

### Bucket Configuration
Update the `BUCKET_NAME` constant to use a different S3 bucket:
```python
BUCKET_NAME = "your-bucket-name"
```

## Export Features
